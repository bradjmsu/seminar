## Time Management Tips

### Keep Things Moving
- Use timers visible to all participants
- Give 5-minute warnings before transitions
- Have Eric handle technical questions during breaks to avoid derailing sessions

### Buffer Management
- Each break has 15 minutes - use as buffer if running behind
- Lunch is 90 minutes - can shorten to 75 if needed
- Never cut Implementation Workshop or Peer Advisory time

### Energy Management
- Start high energy after breaks
- Use polls/interaction when energy drops
- Eric's technical sessions are naturally intense - balance with Brad's practical approach

### Critical Timings
- **Don't Rush:** Implementation Workshop, Technical Reality
- **Keep Tight:** Welcome, Action Planning
- **Flexible:** Breaks, Lunch

## Session Handoffs

**Brad to Eric transitions:**
- "Now Eric will show us why this is technically challenging..."
- "Let's get Eric's technical perspective on this..."

**Eric to Brad transitions:**
- "Brad will help us understand the organizational impact..."
- "Now let's see how Brad made this work in practice..."

## Emergency Time Adjustments

If running significantly behind:
1. Shorten lunch to 75 minutes
2. Combine final break into working time
3. Offer optional post-session time for those who want more
4. Never skip Peer Advisory or Implementation Workshop
