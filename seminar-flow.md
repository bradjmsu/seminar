## Key Design Principles

1. **No Assumed Knowledge**: Start with basics, even for senior professionals
2. **Theory to Practice**: Each concept immediately applied
3. **Building Blocks**: Each session builds on previous learning
4. **Two Expert Approach**: 
   - Strategy expert leads business/implementation topics
   - ML expert provides technical depth when needed
5. **Practical Outcomes**: Every participant leaves with actionable plans

## Session Dependencies

- **ROI Measurement** requires → AI Fundamentals
- **Scaling Strategies** requires → ROI understanding
- **Technical Integration** requires → Landscape knowledge
- **Advanced AI** requires → All Day 1 content
- **Implementation Planning** requires → Everything prior

This structure ensures participants aren't overwhelmed with advanced concepts before understanding the basics, while still delivering cutting-edge content by Day 2.
