## Session Flow

### Part 1: Vendor Decoder Ring (30 min)
**Brad leads, Eric provides technical reality checks**
- "AI-powered" = Often just if/then rules
- "Machine learning" = Sometimes just linear regression
- "Proprietary algorithm" = We don't want to tell you it's basic
- "Seamless integration" = 6-month implementation project

### Part 2: Technical Reality Check (30 min)
**Eric leads with deep technical expertise**
- How to spot fake AI (Eric's checklist)
- Real ML vs. dressed-up analytics
- Integration nightmares vendors hide
- Data requirements they won't mention
- Why their benchmarks are meaningless

### Part 3: Live Demo Teardown (30 min)
**Both facilitate together**
- Real vendor demo with Eric's technical commentary
- Brad translates to business impact
- Audience practices asking killer questions
- Role-play with Eric as "technical validator"

## What Participants Will Walk Away With
- Eric's "Technical Reality Check" checklist
- Questions that make vendors sweat
- Understanding of real vs. fake AI capabilities
- Confidence from Eric's technical backing
- Vendor evaluation framework (technical + practical)

## Materials Needed
- Eric's technical validation framework integrated in the app
- Real vendor proposals accessible in the app for analysis
- Interactive "What this really means" translation guide in the app
- Digital technical complexity assessment tool with scoring
- Vendor demo recordings with synchronized annotation features

## Facilitator Notes
**Tag-team approach maximizes credibility:**
- Brad shares vendor horror stories
- Eric explains WHY technically it was doomed
- Participants see both business and technical angles
- Eric's presence prevents vendor gaslighting later
- Make it fun but technically rigorous
