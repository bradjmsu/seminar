# AI Implementation Reality Check

**Duration:** 90 minutes

## Key Objectives
- Cut through vendor hype to understand what AI actually delivers today
- Share real implementation experiences - the good, bad, and expensive
- Identify common pitfalls before you hit them
- Establish realistic expectations for AI projects

## What Participants Will Walk Away With
- Clear understanding of AI's current capabilities vs. marketing promises
- Checklist of red flags when evaluating AI solutions
- Real-world timelines and resource requirements
- Honest assessment framework for AI readiness

## Materials Needed
- Digital collaborative canvas in the app for real-time capture
- Built-in anonymous polling feature for sensitive topics
- Case studies accessible in the app (failed and successful implementations)
- Interactive implementation cost calculator in the app

## Facilitator Notes
- Start with anonymous poll about AI project failures/challenges
- Encourage brutal honesty - this is a safe space
- Use "bullshit bingo" cards for vendor buzzwords
- Keep focus on practical experiences, not theory
- Have participants share their "AI horror stories" early to set tone
