# Session Management Guide

## Professional Terminology Updates

We've replaced casual language with professional alternatives throughout:

| Original | Updated To | Why It's Better |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| "Cutting Through the AI BS" | "AI Reality Check: Separating Fact from Fiction" | Professional yet still conveys skepticism |
| "BS detector" | "Reality check framework" | Actionable tool name |
| "Vendor BS" | "Vendor claims validation" | Constructive rather than dismissive |
| "Spot BS" | "Identify misleading claims" | Specific and professional |

## Session Timeline Structure

Every session now includes minute-by-minute breakdowns. This helps you:

1. **Stay on track** - Know exactly where you should be
2. **Manage transitions** - Clear handoffs between Brad and Eric
3. **Plan materials** - Know when to queue up demos or templates
4. **Handle questions** - Built-in Q&A time where appropriate

## Example Timeline Breakdown

### AI Reality Check (90 minutes)
```
0:00-0:05   Intro and objectives (Brad)
0:05-0:35   Vendor Decoder Ring (Brad leads, Eric comments)
0:35-0:65   Technical Deep Dive (Eric leads, Brad supports)
0:65-0:85   Live Demo Teardown (Both facilitate)
0:85-0:90   Wrap-up and framework distribution
```

## Key Session Management Tips

### For Brad-Led Sessions
- Open with personal experience
- Keep energy high with interaction
- Use Eric for technical validation
- Watch the clock on story-telling

### For Eric-Led Sessions
- Let technical expertise shine
- Brad keeps business relevance
- Allow deep technical questions
- Use digital whiteboard liberally

### For Co-Led Sessions
- Pre-plan handoff moments
- Use visual cues for transitions
- Build on each other's points
- Model the partnership dynamic

## Digital Timer Display

The Next.js app should show:
- Current segment and time remaining
- Next segment preview
- Overall session progress bar
- Facilitator-only alerts at transition points

## Flexibility Guidelines

While timelines are detailed, you can:
- Extend by 5 min if discussion is rich
- Shorten low-energy segments
- Use break time as buffer
- Never cut interactive exercises

## Energy Management by Timeline

**High Energy Needed:**
- First 10 minutes of any session
- After any break
- Interactive exercises
- Demo portions

**Lower Energy OK:**
- Template walkthroughs
- Individual work time
- Late afternoon planning

This detailed structure ensures smooth delivery while maintaining the honest, practitioner-focused approach that makes this summit valuable.
